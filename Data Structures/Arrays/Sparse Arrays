/*
There is a collection of N strings (There can be multiple occurences of a particular string). Each string's
length is no more than 20 characters. There are also Q queries. For each query, you are given a string,
and you need to find out how many times this string occurs in the given collection of N strings.

Input Format
The first line contains N, the number of strings.
The next N lines each contain a string.
The N + 2nd line contains Q, the number of queries.
The following Q lines each contain a query string.

Constraints
1 <= N <= 1000
1 <= Q <= 1000
1 <= length of any string <= 20

Sample Input 0
4
aba
baba
aba
xzxb
3
aba
xzxb
ab

Sample Output 0
2
1
0

Explanation 0
