Input Format
The first line contains two space-separated integers denoting the respective values of n (the number of
variable-length arrays) and q (the number of queries).
Each line of the subsequent lines contains a space-separated sequence in the format k a[i]0 a[i]1 â€¦
a[i]k - 1 describing the k-element array located at a[i].
Each of the q subsequent lines contains two space-separated integers describing the respective values of i
(an index in array a) and j (an index in the array referenced by a[i]) for a query.

Output Format
For each pair of i and j values (i.e., for each query), print a single integer denoting the element located at
index of the j array referenced by a[i]. There should be a total of lines q of output.
